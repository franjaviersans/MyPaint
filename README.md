Little paint for homework

This was a college homework for a little paint done in Visual Studio 2012 with MFC.

It allows incremental drawing of lines, circles, bezier curves, rectangles, triangles and images. 
The triangles are filled with triangle rasterization.
The images are also filled with triangle rasterization.
